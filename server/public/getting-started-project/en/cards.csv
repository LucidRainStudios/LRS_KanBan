### Simultaneously edit cards and boards

You can keep working on the board (edit other cards, move them across lists, review other
changes) while having an open card view.

### Don't save description changes everytime you leave the card

Local changes are saved even if you switch to another card/board/project/browser tab.

On the same device, you can come back to your local changes at anytime, even after closing the browser tab or restarting your device.

### Remember to save changes!

Save your changes if you have something important! Other users cannot see them before saving.

### Efficiently work with collapsed lists

Cluttered workspace? Save space by collapsing some lists. You can still move cards to them.",,,0,1605293047145301445,1605293048755914187,
